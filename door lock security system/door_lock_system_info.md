There are many types of security systems available today which use RFID,password,PIN,patterns,fingerprint,retina,iris,face,etc for authentication.
This project is prototype for low cost password/PIN protected lock system.

The components used for lock system are:
1.Arduino Uno
2.16*2 LCD
3.4*3 Keypad
4.Servo Motor
5.Jumper Wires

A buzzer or LED can be used to indicate the status of the password.
We even included a push-button so the person entered in the secured room can open the door from inside.
