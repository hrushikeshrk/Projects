The self balancing bot is a two-wheeled robot that balances vertically using 
closed loop algorithm-PID.

The robot follows inverted pendulum principle.It is required to tune the correct values
of Ki,Kp and Kd to assure the stability of bot.

This self balancing bot is controlled using xbee module.

the robot uses IMU system i.e.Accelerometer and Gyroscope to measure angle to inclination 
and rotaional velocity.These values are used to attain stability of the robot.
The IMU used is MPU6050 sensor.
